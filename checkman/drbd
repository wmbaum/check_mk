description:
 This check uses the contents of {/proc/drbd} as sent by the Check_MK linux
 agent. The check analyzes the "Connection State", "Disk State" and "Roles of
 the single nodes.

 The check takes a snapshot from the state during the inventory and compares
 it with the state during the checks. If some of the values differ from the
 inventorized values a CRITICAL state will be shown.

item:
 The name of the DRBD device e.g. {drbd0}

examples:
 # Set expected "cs" to "Connected", first node to primary and second to secondary
 # and both nodes to up-to-date.
 checks += [
   ( 'srvnd01', 'drbd', 'drbd0',
     ( [ 'Primary', 'Secondary' ], [ 'UpToDate', 'UpToDate' ] ) )
 ]

inventory:
 Each configured DRBD device will result in one service during inventory. All
 devices with the connection state "Unconfigured" are skipped.

[parameters]
roles (list): The expected role of each node. Can also be set to None to disable
 alerting on this value.
disk_states (list): The expected disk-state of each node. Can also be set to None
 to disable alerting on this value.
