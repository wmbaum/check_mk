title: Check usage of physical and virtual RAM

description:
 This check measures the current usage of physical RAM and
 virtual memory used by processes. You can define a warning
 and critical level for the usage of virtual memory,
 {not} for the usage of RAM.

 This is not a bug, its a feature. In fact it is the
 only way to do it right (at least for Linux): What
 parts of a process currently reside in physical RAM
 and what parts are swapped out is not related in a
 direct way with the current memory usage.

 Linux tends to swap out
 parts of processes even if RAM is available. It does
 this in situations where disk buffers (are assumed to)
 speed up the overall performance more than keeping
 rarely used parts of processes in RAM.

 For example after a complete backup of your system
 you might experiance that your swap usage has increased
 while you have more RAM free then before. That is
 because Linux has taken RAM from processes in order
 to increase disk buffers.

 So when defining a level to check against, the only
 value that is not affected by such internals of
 memory management is the total amount of {virtual}
 memory used up by processes (not by disk buffers).

 Check_mk lets you define levels in percentage of
 the physically installed RAM or as absolute
 values in MB. The default levels
 are at 150% and 200%. That means that this check
 gets critical if the memory used by processes
 is twice the size of your RAM.

 Hint: If you want to monitor swapping, you probably
 better measure major pagefaults. Please look
 at the check {kernel}.

item:
 {None}

inventory:
 {mem.used} creates one check on each host that provides
 the section {<<<mem>>>}. If that section also outputs
 information about the Windows page file, then the check
 {<<<mem.win>>>} is being used instead.

examples:
 # Change default levels from 150%/200% to 100%/150%:
 memused_default_levels = (100.0, 150.0)
 checks = [
   # make explicit check for hosts with tag "oracle"
   ( ["oracle"], ALL_HOSTS, "mem.used", None, (80.0, 100.0) ),
   # use absolute levels at 8GB / 12GB for some other hosts
   ( ["host12","host34"], "mem.used", None, (8192, 12288) )
 ]

perfdata:
 Three variables are stored: the physical RAM,
 the used swap space and the sum of both. Maximum
 values for both variables are also transmitted, so that
 they can be visualized. All values are in Megabytes (1024 * 1024 bytes).

 The template for PNP4Nagios that is shipped with check_mk
 stacks swap usage on top of RAM usage und thus shows
 the amount of virtual RAM that is used by processes.

 If {mem_extended_perfdata} is set to {True}, then
 additional performance data is output (see below).

[parameters]
warning (int or float): the percentage of virtual memory used
 by processes at which WARNING state is triggered. If the
 level is defined as an integer value then it is interpreted
 as an absolute value in megabytes.
critical (int or float): the percentage or absolute value
 at which CRITICAL state is triggered


[configuration]
memused_default_levels (float, float): Levels used by
 all checks that are created by inventory.

mem_extended_perfdata (boolean): If this variable is set
 to {True}, then the checks outputs additional performance
 data, if the agent provides that information. On Linux
 the amount of mapped and committed memory is output
 (see {Mapped} and {Committed_AS} in {/proc/meminfo}) and
 also the size used for page tables {Pagetables}.
