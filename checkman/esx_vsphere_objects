description:
 This check makes sure that items sent by the ESX special agent (hostsystems
 and VMs) are stil present later on. The information about this data can also
 be used for determining the architecture of a VMWare farm out of the monitoring
 data.

 The check will get critical if a host system or virtual machine, that was once
 present, is now missing.

inventory:
 One service per hostsystem and per VM will be created.

item:
 The text {HostSystem} or {VM} followed by a space followed by the name of the host system
 or VM.
