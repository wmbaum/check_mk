description:
 This check monitors state and performance information of any linux program
 call like for example regular running cronjobs.

 The check uses information provided by the wrapper program {mk-job}. This
 program is shipped with the linux agent and installed to {/usr/bin}.
 {mk-job} is a wrapper which is called instead of the normal program. For
 example if you have a command line {nightly-backup >/dev/null} which gets
 executed by cronjob every night, you can change the command line to
 {mk-job backup nightly-backup >/dev/null} to let mk-job collect information
 about the job during runtime while the string {backup} is the ident of the
 job to be executed. This ident must be an unique identifier for this job
 on each host. When the job finished, mk-job writes the collected data to
 {/var/lib/check_mk_agent/job/<job-id>}. The agent outputs
 all available data to the Check_MK server.

 At the moment this check has no parameters. It reports a {CRITICAL}
 state when the exit code of the job is not 0.

item:
 The ident of the job defined by the first argument to {mk-job}.

inventory:
 One check per job will be created.

perfdata:
 {real_time}: Elapsed real time in seconds.
 {user_time}: Total number of CPU-seconds that the process spent in user mode.
 {system_time}: Total number of CPU-seconds that the process spent in kernel mode.
 {reads}: Number of file system inputs by the process.
 {writes}: Number of file system outputs by the process.
 {max_res_bytes}: Maximum resident set size of the process during its lifetime.
 {avg_mem_bytes}: Average total (data+stack+text) memory use of the process.
