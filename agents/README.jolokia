We are currently preparing a new check agenst the Jolokia agent 
(formerly known as j4p or JMX4Perl). This directory contains
a new agent and matching checks.

Put jolokia.cfg into /etc/check_mk and adapt it to your needs. Put
the plugin into /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins. Put the checks into
~/local/share/check_mk/checks (OMD) or into you checks/ directory (manual
installations).
