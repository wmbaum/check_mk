Title: Make icons selectable in view editor
Component: multisite
State: open

Targetversion: 1.4.0
Class: nastiness

At the moment there is only a select field without any description what to put into it.
A dropdownfield of the available icons would be much better.

Maybe we put a ValueSpec IconSelector (see rule editor) into a foldable area...
