Title: logwatch.ec: Need some fallback mechanism if processing takes too long

Nagios kills Check_MK when it takes too long. When e.g. logwatch.ec is taking
more than 60 seconds, the script is terminated and all unprocessed messages
are lost. This results in data-loss and must be prevented!

This is not only based on the amount of messages to be processed at once,
when the event console is hanging or taking too long for any reason,
the pending messages are lost. Just limiting the number of messages is
no real solution.
