Title: IOPS calculation in diskstat gets wrong numbers
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2012-10-10 12:54:15
Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: bug

Manually tracking the numbers reported by diskstat does not match the numbers
reported by the OS. 2K IOPS show up as >4k sometimes. possible cause from looking
at the check is the timedif handling.
Needs more debugging.
