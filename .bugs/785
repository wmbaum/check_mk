Title: FOREACH_SERVICE in a leaf node does not work for direct host/services

If you use FOREACH_SERVICE within an inner node then you cannot
directly add leaf nodes. The following produces an error:

aggregation_rules[...] = (
  ...
  [
     ( FOREACH_SERVICE, ALL_HOSTS, ".*", "$1$", HOST_STATE ),
  ]
)
