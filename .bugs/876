Title: Notification form broken after personal settings editing

When editing the personal settings while being permitted to edit the custom notifications,
the shown data seems to be broken after submission. For example the title of a custom
notification is set to "Notify by: (no title)" instead of the correct title.

It seems that the CascadingDropdown (and maybe also ListOf) do not use the "value" provided
to the render_input() method. Instead of it they try to fetch the infos from html.var.
