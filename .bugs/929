When using large monitoring environments ( thousands of hosts / hundreds of users )
notifications from nagios take quite some time to process (~1 seconds)

Problem:
If there are multiple users within the contact group of a service, nagios will
start a notification command for each single user, which adds up quite some time
e.g. 10 users -> 10 seconds

Even worse, nagios hangs while the notifications are processed!

Solution:
Each user gets a precompiled notification file.
So its no longer neccessary to read the entire configuration from scratch when a notication is raised
