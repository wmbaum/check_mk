Title: Handle ctrl-c for inventory

Currently, trying to abort an inventory only kills the current inventory. If you
have simply specified cmk -I you'll need to abort as many times as there are h
hosts
It would be nice to be able to press ctrl-c once and have that handled by
cmk so that it aborts the whole process, ideally in a consistent state.
