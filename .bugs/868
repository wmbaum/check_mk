Title: Distributed WATO setup - error message during setting up slaves
Component: wato

In current version, when setting up the local site and a slave site in the main site,
the main site reports that it is not the "preferred peer" while there is no peer setup.
Seems like the naming of the site is somewhat relevant here.
