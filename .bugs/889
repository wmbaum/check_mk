Title: unify CPU load checks, avoid incompatible check parameters
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2013-03-25 11:23:06
Targetversion: 1.2.3
Class: bug

Several checks are in the group "cpu_load". All these checks need to
support predecitve levels by using get_levels(). Resolution: work with
an include file that does the actual checking.
