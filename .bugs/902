Title: Problem with check_mk notify in manually setup check_mk
Component: core
State: open

Targetversion: future
Class: bug

When enable "Debug notifications" from wato (Global settings/Noificatoins)
no notification email are sent, and no debug info is written.
Looks like a file creation/permission problem in directory
/var/lib/check_mk.
If I mkdir /var/lib/check_mk/notify and chmod nagios.nagios
/var/lib/check_mk/notify it works.
Environment: check_mk 1.2.0p3, 1.2.2b1, ubuntu 12.10
