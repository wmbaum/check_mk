Title: Windows fileinfo gets invetorized without escaping backslashes
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: nastiness

The fileinfo check does not escape backslashes upon inventory.
resulting items would be i.e. c:\windows\test.ini
WATO on the other hand does escape them, and in the end the WATO
rules do not match & apply to the service as intended
