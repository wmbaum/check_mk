If the user and the monitoring server exist in different timezones, multisite
has enough smarts to handle this. the problem is with PNP graphs - if the
user views them, he ends up with time information recorded on the nagios
server This breaks the UI logic, and worse, he can't even tell what timezone
the server is running in.

It might be possible to fudge with the numbers when calling PNP.  Otherwise we
could at least add timezone info to the output, but this would only work if
there's just a single monitoring host (thus useless)
