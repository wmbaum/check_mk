Title: View checkboxes: Request-URI Too Large
Component: multisite
State: open

Class: bug

If you select too many checkboxes in a Multisite view
and execute a command, then you will get a
"Request-URI Too Large".

We need to convert the complete checkbox logic including
the page refresh to POST. This will then also fix bug
#759. Postponed until after 1.2.0.
