Title: WATO Users & Contacts misses sorting

The users & contacts page seems to not sort the displayed users alphabetically
(or by any other visible pattern)

It should offer some sorting, we have users with 800+ live contacts in there.
And it's not practical with many less.

Example order:
list all admin accounts
list all user accounts
list all guest accounts

oh, that seems like saying "list be role" - yes, maybe.
per group they should really be sorted a-z
