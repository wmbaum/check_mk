Title: Refreshing autochecks in wato
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2012-09-19 11:58:31
Targetversion: 1.4.0
Class: nastiness

If for example mount options of a services changes, there is no way in the
wato service section to refresh the autochecks to use the new options

Resolution: Make next to [Save manual check configuration] a new button
[Refresh all services], that does a complete reinventory (like cmk -II,
but should only refresh services that are already there!!!)
