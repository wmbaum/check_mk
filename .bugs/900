Title: Check_MK does not handle interval_length != 60 correctly

Reveived via feedback@:

I'm normally using Nagios with the parameter "interval_length" set to
"1". Despite the warnings in the config file I haven't expected problems
with Nagios at all after adjusting all relevant parameters to reflect
this change - but I'm now able to check services at a higher rate then
only 1 minute.

But IMHO check_mk does not reflect this change when displaying the
service details. It seems that the values for " Service normal/retry
check interval" are not correctly multiplied with the configured value
for "interval_length" but (hardcoded?) with the default value of "60".
So in my environment all values are too high as by factor 60:

Example given:

interval_length = 1

check_interval = 10--> check every 10 seconds

retry_interval = 3--> retry after 3 seconds

results in display within check_mk GUI:

Service normal/retry check interval600s/180s

It seems to be a bug in the display only, checks are running correctly.
