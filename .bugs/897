Title: Add some security mechanism to prevent accidential removal of ldap users profile
Component: multisite

It might happen that users are not visible to the ldap sync (maybe by temporary
misconfiguration). When a sync detects that one user is suddenly missing, it
removes the user from the configuration as also the htpasswd mechanism does.
This could lead in bad situations where customized things in multisite get lost,
maybe we find a way to prevent this somehow...?
