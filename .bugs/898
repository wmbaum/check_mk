Title: Unresolvable host prevents loading configuration (bad behaviour)

It seems strange, I am able to add a host to Check_MK by the host name and
while the name can be resolved everything is OK. But once the name is not
resolvable anymore (for whatever reason), the monitoring still works but
if I want to rewrite the config and restart nagios, the process is blocked
by that unresolvable host.

This seems a bit nasty. It would be better to have a warning message or just
no message while applying the config. The monitoring will show me the fact
that the host is not resolvable.
