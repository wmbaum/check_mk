Title: WATO clustered_services differs from cmk conf docs
Component: wato

In WATO you don't see references to PHYSICAL_HOSTS etc. 
These special flags should either be deprecated / taken out of docs or added
to WATO. I'm confused if they're needed or not, but WATO and under-the-hood CM
should match.
