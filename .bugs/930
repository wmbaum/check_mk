Title: cleanup tmp/nagios/checkresults

If nagios stops/crashes/reloads while the service Check_MK creates an checkresult file
the .ok file might be missing. Thus thrashing the checkresults directory since no
one is interested in cleaning up this mess.

Solution:
cronjob in omd which regularly cleans files older than 1 hour
