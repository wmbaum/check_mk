Title: WATO permission "edit views" = False disables display of custom views
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2012-07-06 14:16:42
Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: bug

if a user is restricted of the rights to edit/create views of his own, he'll also not be able to
see any views that you put in his views.mk
It should be possible to still use that were "installed" on setup.
