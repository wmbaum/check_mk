Title: Opera: Globes are only displayed half

Only the right half of the actual data is being displayed.
Maybe Opera has problems with negative values somewhere.

The right part is painted above the other one. The reason is that
in opera the negative scale for flipping the thing does not work:

context.scale(x_scale, 1);

Maybe simply draw the figure vice versa instead of flipping it after drawing?
