Title: Sidebar does not terminate refresh jobs of removed snapins
Component: multisite
State: open

Targetversion: future
Class: bug

When having e.g. the speedometer in the sidebar and removing it, the javascript worker code
remains fetching the speedometer webservice. The worker should detect that the snapin has
been removed and stop updating the data.

Not a general problem: The speedometer uses its own scheduler. Must be fixed individually.
