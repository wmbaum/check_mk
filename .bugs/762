Title: Command form off at empty table, but that might change
Component: multisite
State: open

Targetversion: future
Class: nastiness

If a view has no rows then the command form is deactivated.
But as time goes by the view might have entries. The command
form is not being activated automtically - nevertheless. Better
solution: Always have it active. When it comes to executing
give then a warning if not items for the commands are available.
