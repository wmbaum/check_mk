Title: mounts check reinventory seems to not change fs options

This is a bit confusing, but it seems the mount options stay hardcoded
even if you run a new WATO inventory of a given system.
This goes as far as showing "OK" on the inventory screen, but the check
stays WARN anyways

OK - missing: data=journal, exceeding: data=writeback

You can test by changing the journal option forth and back.
